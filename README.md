# Multi-day Weather Web Application

## About 
A Multi-day weather web application that displays the current forcast and a multi-day forecast of a city searched by the user.

It uses Google Geocoding API to fetch Geo-coordinates of a city and the Dark Sky API to gather weather data from that city to display a beautiful accurate weather web app with animated icons.
